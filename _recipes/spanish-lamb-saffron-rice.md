title:  "Spanish Lamb & Saffron Rice"
image: spanish-lamb.jpg
tags: lamb, rice, main course

ingredients:
- 2 Frenched Racks of Lambs
- 1 cup long grain white rice
- 6oz shishito peppers
- 1 bunch parsley
- 1 shallot
- 6 tbsps romesco sauce (contains almonds)
- 1oz castelvetrano olives
- 3 tbsps golden raisins
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tbsp spanish spice blend (smoked paprika, ground cumin, ground coriander, dried mexican oregano, cayenne pepper, and ground cinnamon)
- 2 red, yellow, or orange bell peppers

directions:
- Roast the lamb, place an oven rack in the center of the oven; preheat to 450°F. Line a sheet pan with foil. Pat the lamb dry with paper towels; season on all sides with salt, pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). Place on the sheet pan, bone side down. Roast 27 to 29 minutes for medium (125°F), or until cooked to your desired degree of doneness.* Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 10 minutes.
- Cook and finish the rice, once the lamb has roasted about 10 minutes, in a medium pot, combine the rice, saffron, a big pinch of salt, and 2 cups of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook, without stirring, 13 to 15 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork; stir in the raisins. Cover to keep warm.
- Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel and thinly slice the shallot. Cut off and discard the stems of the bell peppers. Halve lengthwise; remove the ribs and seeds, then large dice. Pit and roughly chop the olives. Roughly chop the parsley leaves and stems. Cut off and discard the stems of the shishito peppers; halve lengthwise. Thoroughly wash your hands, knife, and cutting board immediately  after handling.
- While the lamb rests, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced shallot, diced bell peppers, and halved shishito peppers; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned and softened. Add the vinegar (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the liquid has cooked off. Turn off the heat; stir in the chopped olives. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired.
- In a bowl, combine the romesco sauce and mayonnaise. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Slice the rested lamb between each bone. Serve the sliced lamb with the finished rice and cooked vegetables. Garnish the lamb with the romesco mayo, almonds, and chopped parsley. Enjoy!
