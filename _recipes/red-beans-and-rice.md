- Find and discard the 3 bay leaves.
- Place chicken in a large mixing bowl, then shred the meat with 2 forks.
- While you are shredding the chicken, thicken the gravy by simmering the red beans until desired consistency (~5 to 10 minutes). Stir occasionally.
- Place shredded chicken back in the Instant Pot.
- Taste & adjust the seasoning accordingly.

Last time we tried this it was without the chicken and no serranos. We talked about adding 2lbs of sausage, but maybe the chicken makes up for that. Amounts can always change though! We also talked about trying to cook the rice in the instant pot - do we want to try that this time?
