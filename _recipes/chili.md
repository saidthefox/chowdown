title:  "Instant Pot Chili"
image: chili.jpg
tags: mains, spicy, beef, warm

ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 pound ground beef (90% lean)
- 4 gloves of garlic, minced
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper
- 1 red bell pepper
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon chili pequin, crushed
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 4 tablespoons tamato paste
- 14.5 ounce can (1 3/4 cups) low sidium beef broth or chicken broth
- 28 ounce can fire roasted crushed tomatoes
- 15 ounce can kidney beans (rinsed and drained)
- 15 ounce can black beans (rinsed and draiend)
- shredded cheese
- sour cream
- fritos
- cilantro

directions:
- Press Saute to turn on saute setting on Instant Pot. Add the olive oil and heat until hot. Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes, until onion starts to soften.
- Add the ground beef and cook, stirring to crumble the meat, until beef is browned, about 5 minutes.
- Stir in the garlic and then press Cancel to turn off the pot.
- Add the bell pepper, chili powder, cumin, dried oregano, garlic powder, brown sugar, salt, pepper, tomato paste and broth to the pot. Stir and scrape up any bits that are stuck to the bottom of the pot.
- Add the crushed tomatoes and beans on top of the other ingredients and DO NOT STIR the tomatoes or beans in. This will help to prevent you from getting a burn warning during pressure cooking.
- Close the Instant Pot lid and turn the steam release valve to the sealing position. Pressure cook on high pressure for 15 minutes. The Instant Pot will take some time to reach pressure and then the cook time will start counting down.
- When the cook time ends, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes by leaving the Instant Pot alone. Then quick release the remaining pressure by carefully turning the steam release valve to the venting position using the handle of a long spoon. Once the steam finishes escaping and the pin drops down, open the Instant Pot lid.
- Stir chili and serve with toppings, as desired.

We tried this recipe January 2021. It was good, but underwhelming. The spice was pretty on point night of, but leftovers were lacking. It was solid chili, just nothing exciting. I added the green bell pepper to the recipe as something else to maybe try, maybe some different peppers might be exciting to add as well - some chipotle's to add some smokey flavor? Not sure. Either way, if we make this again, lets be liberal with the spices and not shy about adding more veggies or trying some different meat options!
